This is a repo to practice AI assisted coding

**Task 0:**

The code to be corrected contained some errors. The loop was running infinitely because the counter was not decremented

There was an idea of making a recursive function which did not call itself properly and the base case was incorrect, it had no condition. 

_Adjustments:_ 

- Code corrected in "pico-style" 
- Recursive call to the function adjusted
- Conditions if, or added to the base case for proper resolution

**Task 1:**

The code is printing the script name when only the arguments are necessary

_Adjustments:_

The script name is argv[0]
Looping over the arguments starting from index 1 in order to skip printing argv[0].
