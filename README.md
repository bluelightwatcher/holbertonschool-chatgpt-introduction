This is a repo to practice AI assisted coding

**Task 0:**

The code to be corrected contained some errors. The loop was running infinitely because the counter was not decremented

There was an idea of making a recursive function which did not call itself properly and the base case was incorrect, it had no condition. 

_Adjustments:_ 

- Code corrected in "pico-style" 
- Recursive call to the function adjusted
- Conditions if, or added to the base case for proper resolution
